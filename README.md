# moody-calculator
An iOS calculator clone, except it judges you for simple calculations or for using it too much.

## About

My math teacher used to say not to rely on calculators because we would never carry them everywhere in our pockets.
Even though that math teacher was sorely wrong, I do think we should be able to do basic calculations without aid.

Moody Calculator channels the spirit of that 5th grade math teacher into an iOS calculator clone.

## Getting Started
`git clone` the repository and open in xCode. Run the app in the simulator or connect to an iPhone.

## Usage
Simple calculations will trigger some response from the calculator. Usage over 7 times will trigger more drastic responses at certain intervals.
